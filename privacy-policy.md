## Introduction
This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you use the "PickOne - Pick Random Coding Problem" Chrome extension (the "Extension").

## Information We Collect
The Extension does not collect any personal information from you. It only interacts with the active web page to select a random coding problem for you to solve. We do not store, transmit, or share any of your data.

## How We Use Your Information
Since the Extension does not collect any personal information, we do not use or share any of your data.

## Third-Party Services
The Extension does not use or integrate with any third-party services. All of its functionality is self-contained within the Extension.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to the Extension's homepage or sending you a notification).
